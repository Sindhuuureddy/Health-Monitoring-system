INTRODUCTION

In regions where accessing healthcare facilities is challenging, especially during critical conditions, we have introduced a groundbreaking method to address this gap. Our solution involves continuous monitoring of a patient's vital signs, with the collected data automatically transmitted to a central server. This enables doctors to remotely access and monitor the patient's health condition in real-time. This breakthrough is particularly valuable in remote areas where traditional monitoring methods are impractical.
Traditionally, monitoring diﬀerent health parameters required separate instruments, making the process cumbersome and often infeasible in remote settings. In response, we have developed an integrated module that consolidates the monitoring of key health metrics—temperature, heartbeat, and oxygen saturation level (SpO2). This compact module simplifies the monitoring process, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
The backbone of our system is the Internet of Things (IoT), a technology that enables seamless communication between devices over the internet. This interconnected network allows for the eﬃcient transmission of health data, overcoming geographical barriers and facilitating remote patient monitoring. The hardware aspect of our system involves the use of an Arduino board and various sensors to capture the patient's health parameters.
In terms of user interface, the system streamlines the complex health data into an easily interpretable LCD display. This display provides a quick snapshot of the patient's current health
status, making it comprehensible for both healthcare professionals and caregivers. Furthermore, the system is designed to trigger alerts to caretakers in critical situations, ensuring prompt attention during emergencies.
Previously it was impossible to monitor the patient by a doctor in remote areas during critical conditions. So we introduced a method which continuously monitors the patient's condition and automatically sends the data to the server, so the doctor can access the data continuously and we can intimate the caretaker when the patient is in critical condition. In previous methods, monitoring of patients can be done only by using diﬀerent instruments for diﬀerent parameters. So, we decided to monitor the required conditions of patients by assembling diﬀerent instruments in a single module.Nowadays IoT is the widely used technology. The growth of the internet is tremendous and has been further extended to connecting things through the internet. All devices are connected to one another with various smart technologies to create worldwide ubiquitous network called Internet of Things (IoT) The hardware monitors the patient’s health status like the temperature, heartbeat,oxygen saturation level(spo2) using Arduino board and sensors connected to it The system is getting only 3 parameters as input, and the output being LCD display.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
PROBLEM: Patients dealing with heart and respiratory diseases face the challenge of regular doctor visits to monitor their vital signs. Additionally, the cost of purchasing electronic devices for home monitoring proves to be a financial burden for many individuals.

SOLUTION: In response to this challenge, the Health Monitoring System emerges as a transformative solution. Designed to be cost-effective, this system alleviates the financial burden on patients, providing a comprehensive and continuous monitoring alternative. Particularly advantageous for individuals in rural areas, the system offers accessibility to vital sign
monitoring within the comfort of their homes. Its user-friendly design ensures ease of operation, empowering patients to actively participate in their health management. By facilitating continuous monitoring, the system enables early detection of any deviations, allowing for timely medical intervention and reducing the need for frequent clinic visits. Beyond cost savings, this solution enhances the overall quality of healthcare in underserved regions. Moreover, the Health Monitoring System has the potential to integrate with telemedicine, further extending healthcare access and guidance to individuals, ultimately contributing to a more proactive and empowered approach to health management. In essence, it serves as a pivotal boon for patients, bridging gaps in affordability, accessibility, and timely healthcare intervention.
